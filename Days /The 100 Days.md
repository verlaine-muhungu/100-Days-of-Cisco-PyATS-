**How to follow the days?**

Each day is a new opportunity to learn. Share what you’ve discovered by posting on LinkedIn or writing a short blog.

If you’re struggling to understand a topic, feel free to ask your questions in the Webex space. Community members will respond as soon as possible, keeping in mind that time zones may affect availability.

There’s no need to rush. Let’s take this learning journey step by step :turtle:
